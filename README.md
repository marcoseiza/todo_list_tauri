# A ToDo List in Rust, Svelte using Tauri Front End

Works in MacOS, have not checked out Windows or Linux.

Read more about it here in my blog, [Starting Out With Rust and Svelte Using Tauri](http://meizayaga.com/posts/9b762fca-c59f-4c6e-8684-f2885a8df1e6)

## New Features
- Github oauth2 login.
- Encrypted cloud storage with firebase. (All your tasks bodies and group names are encrypted using [Rust Cocoon](https://crates.io/crates/cocoon))

Super excited for these ^
